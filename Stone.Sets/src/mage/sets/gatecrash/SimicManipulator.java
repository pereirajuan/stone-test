/**
* Gatecrash FAQ (01.2013)
*
* The power of the target creature is checked both as you target it and as the ability
* resolves. If the power of the target creature when the ability resolves is greater
* than the number of +1/+1 counters removed from Simic Manipulator, the ability will
* be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't gain control of any
* creature, but the counters removed as a cost remain removed.
