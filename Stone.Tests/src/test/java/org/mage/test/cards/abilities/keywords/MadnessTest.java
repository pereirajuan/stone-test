     * 702.34. Madness 702.34a Madness is a keyword that represents two
     * abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card
     * with madness is in a player’s hand. The second is a triggered ability
     * that functions when the first ability is applied. “Madness [cost]” means
     * “If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but may
     * exile it instead of putting it into his or her graveyard” and “When this
     * card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather
     * than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn’t, he or she puts this
     * card into his or her graveyard.” 702.34b Casting a spell using its
     * madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules
     * 601.2b and 601.2e–g.
