/**
 * 702.64. Delve
 *
 * 702.64a Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell that has delve is on
 * the stack. "Delve" means "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may exile any
 * number of cards from your graveyard. Each card exiled this way reduces the cost to cast
 * this spell by {1}." Using the delve ability follows the rules for paying additional
 * costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g. #
 *
 * 702.64b Multiple instances of delve on the same spell are redundant.
