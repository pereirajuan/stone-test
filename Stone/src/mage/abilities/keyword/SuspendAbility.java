/**
 *
 * 502.59. Suspend
 *
 * 502.59a Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static
 * ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a player's hand. The second
 * and third are triggered abilities that function in the removed-from-the-game zone.
 * "Suspend N--[cost]" means "If you could play this card from your hand, you may pay
 * [cost] and remove it from the game with N time counters on it. This is a special
 * action that doesn't use the stack," and "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this
 * card is suspended, remove a time counter from it," and "When the last time counter
 * is removed from this card, if it's removed from the game, play it without paying its
 * mana cost if able. If you can't, it remains removed from the game. If you play it
 * this way and it's a creature, it gains haste until you lose control of it."
 *
 * 502.59b A card is "suspended" if it's in the removed-from-the-game zone, has suspend,
 * and has a time counter on it.
 *
 * 502.59c Playing a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules for
 * paying alternative costs in rules 409.1b and 409.1f-h.
 *
 * The phrase "if you could play this card from your hand" checks only for timing
 * restrictions and permissions. This includes both what's inherent in the card's
 * type (for example, if the card with suspend is a creature, it must be your main
 * phase and the stack must be empty) and what's imposed by other abilities, such
 * as flash or Meddling Mage's ability. Whether you could actually follow all steps
 * in playing the card is irrelevant. If the card is impossible to play due to a
 * lack of legal targets or an unpayable mana cost, for example, it may still be
 * removed from the game with suspend.
 *
 * Removing a card from the game with its suspend ability is not playing that card.
 * This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
 *
 * If a spell with suspend has targets, the targets are chosen when the spell is
 * played, not when it's removed from the game.
 *
 * If the first triggered ability of suspend is countered, no time counter is removed.
 * The ability will trigger again during its owner's next upkeep.
 *
 * When the last time counter is removed from a suspended card, the second triggered
 * ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the time counter was removed
 * or whose effect removed it. (The _Time Spiral_ reminder text is misleading on this point.)
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend is countered, the card can't be played.
 * It remains in the removed-from-the-game zone without any time counters on it for the
 * rest of the game, and it's no longer considered suspended.
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend resolves, the card's owner must play the
 * spell if possible, even if that player doesn't want to. Normal timing considerations
 * for the spell are ignored (for example, if the suspended card is a creature and this
 * ability resolves during your upkeep, youâ€™re able to play the card), but other play
 * restrictions are not ignored.
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend resolves and the suspended card can't be
 * played due to a lack of legal targets or a play restriction, for example, it remains
 * in the removed-from-the-game zone without any time counters on it for the rest of the
 * game, and it's no longer considered suspended.
 *
 * As the second triggered ability of suspend resolves, if playing the suspended card
 * involves an additional cost, the card's owner must pay that cost if able. If he or
 * she can't, the card remains removed from the game. If the additional cost includes
 * mana, the situation is more complex. If the player has enough mana in his or her mana
 * pool to pay the cost, that player must do so. If the player can't possibly pay the
 * cost, the card remains removed from the game. However, if the player has the means
 * to produce enough mana to pay the cost, then he or she has a choice: The player may
 * play the spell, produce mana, and pay the cost. Or the player may choose to play no
 * mana abilities, thus making the card impossible to play because the additional mana
 * can't be paid.
 *
 * A creature played via suspend comes into play with haste. It still has haste after
 * the first turn it's in play as long as the same player controls it. As soon as another
 * player takes control of it, it loses haste.
